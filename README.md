# Learning R 101

This is just a folder containing small R projects that I have done to help me understand
the basics of the language

### So... Where did I start?

[R programming ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/) course, by Josh Hopkings University is great course to start. It teaches you
the basics and give you tools that you can perfect as you gain experience. 
[SWIRL](https://swirlstats.com/students.html) can also be a great tool if  you are more into learning by doing code.

### And where do I go from there?

[R for Data Science] (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html) is a great beggininers book that has pretty much all the basics.
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) is also a great library where all R functions are described. 

### What if want to make graphics?

[R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/index.html) is a good start as it will have a lot of the basics on graphs and commands

### And what about maps?

[Geocomputation with R] (https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) have a lot of information on how to make maps

### Now how do I make readable maps?
