#Learning R 101

This is just a folder containing small R projects that I have done to help me understand
the basics of the language

## So... Where did I start?

[R programming ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/) course, by Josh Hopkings University is great course to start. It teaches you
the basics and give you tools that you can perfect as you gain experience. [SWIRL](https://swirlstats.com/students.html) can also be a great tool if 
you are more into learning by doing code.

## And where do I go from there?

The good thing about R the availability of tools to work with any type of problem. [R for Data Science] (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a great beggininers book that has pretty much all the basics.
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) is also a great library where all R functions are described.
