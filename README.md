# Learning R - 101

This is just a folder containing small R projects that I have done to help me understand
the basics of the language

### So... Where did I start?

- [R programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/) course, by Josh Hopkings University is great course to start. It teaches you the basics and give you tools that you can perfect as you gain experience. 
- [SWIRL](https://swirlstats.com/students.html) can also be a great tool if  you are more into learning by doing code.

### And where do I go from there?

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html) is a great beginners book that has pretty much all the basics.
- [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) is also a great library where all R functions are described. 
- [Cheat sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are great when you are working with a specific package that is relatively new to you

### What if want to make graphics?

[R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/index.html) is a good start, as it will have many of the basics on graphs and commands

### And what about maps?

[Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) have a lot of information on how to make maps

### Now how do I make my output pretty?

This has been my toughest challenge so far. I did found resources to help in the design of the output:
- [Top R color palettes](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/top-r-color-palettes-to-know-for-great-data-visualization/) has a good overall presentation of different palettes and colors available;
- [Color brewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) is good place if you are looking for a personalized color layout;
- For maps, [tmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html), has nice basic layouts;
- The [Cran](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/index.html) for tmap is also very detailed and good if you are looking for specific personalization

### And what is next?

[The classic Titanic Problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) is something I am looking forward do doing when I have free time left!
