#Solving the problem based on a tree model

#### A simple tree model

Almost no work done on the data, I just let R do the work. I did the model then pruned the unessary parts. The accuracy rate of the model was 0.78.
note: 0 = Dead, 1=Alive
note2: First division is by gender where 0=Female and 1=Male
